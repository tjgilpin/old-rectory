We make our own sausages for both meat-eaters and vegetarians alike, cure our own bacon, as well as making Rectory Baked Beans, Black Pudding, Hash Browns & so much more. Our kippers and smoked salmon are smoked in our in-house smokery. Served over two courses and accompanied by Rectory Toast which paired with our multi-award winning Marmalade. 

We are so pleased to be able to extend our offering to everybody; guests, locals and visitors alike. The Old Rectory team invites you to join us for breakfast. We serve every day from 8.30 am to 10 am. Due to limited space booking is essential and we ask that you call ahead to let us know you’d like to join us. We’ll do our best to host you. 

Breakfast is included in our room prices for all guests. For those visiting us just for breakfast is £17.50 per person.
