      Meet Lionel, the man who made The Old Rectory what it is today. With a
      background in fashion &amp; a flair for interior design, Lionel is the
      brains (and the eye) behind our beautiful spaces – from the handpicked
      artwork to the custom-made cushions you won’t want to get up from.


      He’s been with the Rectory since day one and is never far from the action – whether he’s redesigning a room, pottering in the garden, or sneaking a slice of cake (we see you Lionel!).

      Running the main house like a well-oiled (and very stylish) machine is
      Natalie, along with her brilliant team of hospitality heroes. They’ve got
      hearts of gold, years of experience, and more tips on Hastings that a
      local tour guide.


      From greeting you with a grin to delivering breakfasts, weddings &amp; afternoon teas worthy of a Michelin Key, they’ve mastered the art of making every guest feel like royalty – with a cuppa always close by.

      team – a group of calm, kind and wonderfully skilled therapists. They’re
      up to date with all the latest techniques and tailor every treatment to
      you.


      From oncology &amp; pregnancy massage to glowing facials, perfectly polished pedicures, and everything in between, this team is here to help you float out feeling like your very best self.

      Down in the Café, things are brewing – literally. Hattie, Lindsey and Tom
      are the smiling trio behind every silky flat white &amp; freshly baked
      slice of heaven.


      Whether you’re after a lazy brunch, a speedy espresso, or just an excuse to eat cake (no judgement here), they’re the ones making it happen – with good vibes and great tunes guaranteed.

  - title: Our Chefs – Flavour Makers & Foodie Wizards
    body: >-
      Here at The Old Rectory, we don’t mess around when it comes to food. Our
      chefs are passionate about every bite, using seasonal, local ingredients
      to create dishes that feel both comforting and a little bit special.


      Let’s talk Janek, our resident smokehouse sorcerer. He’s the genius behind our hot smoked salmon &amp; kippers, and the hands behind our home-cured bacon, handmade sausages and indulgent black pudding. When he’s not manning the BBQ at a wedding, you’ll find him tending our edible garden – or giving some TLC to our fish pond. Yes, really.


      Matthew is king of canapes and the master of Sunday roasts. His seasonal menus are all about honest, hearty food done right – with a little flair thrown in for good measure. From delicate bites to full-on feasts, he makes sure every meal tells a story (and ends with a clean plate).


      And then there’s Hattie, again! She rules the café kitchen, curating a day to day menu that hits the sweet spot for breakfast, brunch and lunch. All our cakes? Her handiwork. All the “mmm” sounds coming from the café? Also her fault. You’ve been warned.

      Rarely spotted but never unnoticed, Zeline and Marcus manage and maintain
      our beautiful walled garden. From tiny seedlings to a sprawling grapevine,
      these two strike the perfect balance between creating an ecological haven
      for birds, bees, and guests. They’re an iconic duo who take the time to
      ensure that, no matter the season, our gardens always have the wow factor.



      They also tend to the indoor plants—truly the safest pair of hands to bring a touch of green to our communal spaces, dining room tables, and each guest room.

  - title: Shaun – Sculptor & Explorer
    body: Sculptor, explorer, and silent partner, Shaun is Lionel’s right-hand man.
      Long-time friend and Old Rectory alumnus, Shaun has several art
      installations throughout the Rectory, café, and garden. When he’s not off
      exploring the globe, you’ll often find him sampling delights and chatting
      with friends in the café.
