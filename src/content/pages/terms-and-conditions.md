When booking a room, we require credit card details as a guarantee to confirm your reservation.

### Minimum Stays

At weekends, there is a minimum two night stay. Although occasionally one night stays may be available, please call to find out more.
 
### Cancellations

Reservations cancelled outside 48 hours of your arrival will incur no charge.

Reservations cancelled with 48 hours notice, will incur a charge of 100% of the total booking.

In the event of a no show, the amount equivalent to 100% of the total booking value will be charged.

If you are concerned about the possibility of cancellation you are advised to take out travel insurance.
 
### Wedding and Event cancellations

Deposits for weddings (first deposit) and events are non-refundable.

### Check Out

Check out is by 11.00am every day.
 
### Children

We are an adult-only hotel and can only host children over 10. In some circumstances, this policy can be amended for events but please ask us first. Our new additional property, Rose Cottage, is a self-contained family-friendly space that sleeps up to four.

### Pets

We love animals, but unfortunately not everyone does, therefore for the comfort of all guests, we cannot accommodate pets at the Old Rectory.

### Smoking

The Old Rectory is a no smoking house, this includes the use of e-cigarettes and vapes.  Non-compliance will result in an additional charge of Â£200 being added to your account to cover extra cleaning costs and the resulting delay in re-letting the room.
