Café at The Old Rectory is an elegantly designed space that offers all the important things in life: good coffee, good food, and good vibes. Our carefully planned seasonal menu features ingredients from trusted local suppliers, enhanced by in-house expertise—from our expert cake baker to our on-site garden smokers. Open seven days a week from 10 am to 4 pm, Café at The Old Rectory is the perfect place to catch up with old friends, relax after a walk with the dog, or enjoy some solo time with a cup of tea and a good book.

**We take pride** in using the best local and seasonal ingredients, where possible.

**Our smoked meats and fish** are prepared in our very own garden smokery by Janek, who also makes our sausages and cures our bacon.

**Our bread** is baked onsite by our friend and master baker, Emmanuel Hadjiandreou, whilst our sourdough crumpets are produced in small batches by Rebecca, from Crump and Grind, and our baps come from Lee at Poppyseed bakery, Bexhill.

**Our exclusive coffee blend** is freshly roasted by Jonny at the Rye Bay Coffee Company, while all of our dairy products comes from the award-winning Hinxden Farm in Benenden.

**Our mushrooms** are grown just a stone's throw away by Robbie at Basil's Fungi Farm in Hastings, less than a mile from our door.

**Every cake and dessert** is baked in-house by Hattie and our signature **marmalade** is not only homemade by Christine, it's award-winning.
