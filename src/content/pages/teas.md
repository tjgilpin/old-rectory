All of our Teas are served with loose leaf tea and cafetiere coffee. Prosecco, Champagne or English Sparkling wine can also be added; this can be pre-ordered as a welcoming surprise or on the day if the mood takes you! 

We ask that all teas are booked in advance to ensure we are properly prepared to host you; this can be done via email or over the phone. Groups of 6 or more may be asked to pay a small deposit ahead of their booking. 

Our Teas are a great way to cater for small events such as Baby Showers, for more information email our events manager Natalie on natalie@theoldrectoryhastings.co.uk.
