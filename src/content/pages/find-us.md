The Old Rectory is a 20 minute walk from Hastings train station & a great way to get a glimpse of the town before checking-in. With regular services to and from London, Rye & Brighton it's a great alternative to driving. 

We have a small driveway with space for up to three cars. We allocate these spaces on a first come first serve basis & recommend that guests who are able to park on the driveway leave their car for the duration of their stay as we cannot guarantee the space will still be available upon their return. There are a handful of paid car parks nearby & plenty of street parking.
