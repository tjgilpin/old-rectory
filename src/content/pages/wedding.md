A relaxed and stylish venue awaits you at The Old Rectory. We offer you a bespoke service where our gorgeous contemporary house and beautiful walled garden can become yours. Both the house and our garden terrace are licensed to conduct civil ceremonies and weddings. Within our stunning garden we can accommodate up to eighty guests, or for a more intimate celebration, up to forty guests can relax and use the house to enjoy their day.

We work closely with you throughout the planning process to help bring your dream day to life.
