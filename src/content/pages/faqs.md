## Is there parking at The Old Rectory?

We have a small driveway with space for up to three cars. We allocate these spaces on a first come first serve basis & recommend that guests who are able to park on the driveway leave their car for the duration of their stay as we cannot guarantee the space will still be available upon their return. There are a handful of paid car parks nearby & plenty of street parking. The Old Rectory is a 20 minute walk from Hastings train station & a great way to get a glimpse of the town before checking-in. With regular services to and from London, Rye & Brighton it's a great alternative to driving. 

## Do you have any twin rooms?

We have two rooms that can be set up as Twin rooms. [Sinnock](/our-rooms/sinnock/) & [All Saints](/our-rooms/all-saints/) both have the capacity to be set as twin rooms. [All Saints](/our-rooms/all-saints/) can be upgraded to a suite that gives guests two separate rooms rather than two separate beds.

## Are there hairdryers/robes/slippers in the rooms?

All our rooms have hairdryers, robes & our very own Copley Body Wash & Copley Shampoo. The bathrooms are also equipped with eco-friendly vanity kits & shower caps. Slippers & toothbrushes are available, simply ask a member of staff and we will provide you with them.

## Do you allow children at The Old Rectory?

We are an adult-only hotel and can only host children over 10. In some circumstances, this policy can be amended for events but please ask us first. Our new additional property, Rose Cottage, is a self-contained family-friendly space that sleeps up to four. 

## How close is the Old Town/Beach?

We are situated on the peripheral of Hastings Old Town; the high street is opposite our front door & historic All Saints Church is right next door. The beach is a five-minute stroll away.

## How accessible is The Old Rectory?

As a listed building there are limitations to our accessibility. The front door is raised and there a numerous steps in the garden. We unfortunately do not have any ground floor rooms. We host Sunday Lunches & our Afternoon Teas on the ground floor which is accessible to those with low mobility. All our rooms can be equipped with non-slip mats, moveable handrails & shower-safe stools. We aim to make everyone welcome at The Old Rectory, if you have accessibility queries, please don’t hesitate to give us a call and help us find a way to accommodate your needs.

## Are you open to guests who are not staying?

Yes! Breakfast is served everyday and is open to non-residents, as long as they give us a call to make sure we have tables available. Our teas are served Monday-Saturday and are open to everyone. We have a no-children under 10 policy that can be open to discussion ahead of an event.

## Which rooms are garden-facing?

[Croft](/our-rooms/croft/), [Cobourg](/our-rooms/cobourg/) and [Tackleway](/our-rooms/tackleway/) all face the garden. [Bourne](/our-rooms/bourne/) has a garden-facing room & a churchyard view from the other bedroom.

## Can you cater to a gluten-free diet?

We have a small kitchen so we can’t guarantee there are not traces of allergens present in our preparation areas. However, almost all our breakfast dishes (excluding one option) can be tailored to suit a gluten-free diet. We also have a wide range of dairy alternatives & similar vegan & vegetarian options.

## Are dogs allowed?

Unfortunately, The Old Rectory is not a dog-friendly hotel. We LOVE dogs but, out of consideration for those who don’t or cannot love dogs as much as we do we cannot host them.

Our most recent addition Rose Cottage is a self-contained space off site that is dog friendly, complete with a food bowl, dog bed & enclosed courtyard space. 

## What is your cancellation policy?

We offer a 48 hour cancellation policy.

## Do you have a corporate rate?

We offer a corporate rate to businesses who require a location for visiting colleagues to stay. This rate must be agreed upon with The Old Rectory management and is only available to businesses with an established relationship with The Old Rectory.

## Do you have a Sustainability Policy?

Our Sustainability Policy is covered by three main principles. The First is a fundamental focus on the conservation of resources through efficient use of water and energy and careful consideration for a ‘Reduce, Recycle & Reuse’ ethos. The Second Principle calls for products to be locally sourced as much as possible from like-minded businesses. We also encourage plant-based produced for those of our guests who aim to uphold these ideals. The Third Principle focuses on the building itself & a business-wide promise to treasure and uphold our beautiful house & its garden through constant care, regeneration & development. Our garden encourages biodiversity & wild spaces & is home to a compost site enriched with some of our food waste. These principles are instilled throughout all training at The Old Rectory & are upheld in our day-to-day operation.

We always do our best to make The Old Rectory a welcoming and comfortable place to be; if you have a question that hasn't been covered here get in touch and a member of the team will be happy to help you.
