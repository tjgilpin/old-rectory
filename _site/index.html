  <details><summary><span>“</span>I worked with Tim on several international ecommerce website launches at Universal Music Group over the last 8+ years.</summary><p>    
<p>Tim was an absolute joy to work with! His impressive technical knowledge was an invaluable asset to all business units he interacted with. He helped my team get through several complex and time sensitive website launches over the years - we couldn't have done it with his technical know-how and graceful guidance!</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  Tim's ability to problem solve, prioritize, and execute under pressure was second to none. Whenever we had a highly complex problem that required the technical skills of a developer, but also the communication skills and leadership of a project manager, Tim was the go-to guy to lead the charge. 
  <p>
  What I really appreciated about Tim is not just his skill set - but he is an extremely friendly and patient person as well. I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again - if you have the chance to work with Tim, take it!

  <details><summary><span>“</span>I worked with Tim on many projects. Whatever the task or discussion, Tim would always give valuable insight, causing me to consider different points of view.</summary><p>
<p>He is clear on the direction that a website - or the front-end of a webapp - needs to take, in order for it to meet the needs of the business, for its UX &amp; UI, for its technical implementation, and for how it fits into the system &amp; business as a whole.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  His abilities stretch far beyond front-end design & build. Both in terms of the technologies, but for example in terms of the data feeding in and out of the front-end and making use of it.
  </p>
  <p>
  As well as having the necessary abilities, Tim is fun to work with.

<p>During this time he was promoted to lead front end developer &amp; designer (responsibilities included managing the front end development &amp; design team) and was then promoted to director of front end development &amp; design.</p>
  </p>
  <p>
  He was a passionate advocate for best of breed UI/UX and worked on many projects including internationalisation (languages and currencies), reducing friction in the checkout process, improving discoverability and helped merchandising teams with understanding how to make data driven decisions.
